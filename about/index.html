<p>I have lived in or around Raleigh, North Carolina most of my life.<br />
I love music, and I enjoy writing and programming.<br />
I am a maker.</p>
<p>As a kid I was always making something out of cereal boxes and scotch tape or Legos. As I've
gotten older I've discovered other things to make, including music, electronics, and
photography. Most of my current creative energy goes into programming, but I still play with
Legos sometimes.</p>
<p>Since 2014 I've been a developer at <a href="https://www.factor500.com/">Factor500</a>. Thankfully
I also get to do a bit on the sys admin side, which I really enjoy as a occasional change of pace.
These days I mostly work with Python and Linux. I'm still partial to software that is built in C.</p>
<p>I've been really interested in open source for years. I remember being excited that Tivo became
popular because it ran Linux, and now Linux is everywhere. Some of my personal projects have
included a web based twitter client with PHP and jquery, a note taking application (inspired
by Notational Velocity) in C#, and lots of HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>

<h2 id="this-site">This Site</h2>
<p>I got lazy with the HTML and this site is now built with <a href="https://www.getzola.org">zola</a> and hosted via GitHub pages.
I spent too much time editing my init.el, so now mostly done with a combination
of <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VS Code</a> and <a href="https://neovim.io">Neovim</a>. 
The theme/styling is <a href="https://oxal.org/projects/sakura/">sakura.css</a></p>
<p>This site was previously hand coded with (mostly) care in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a>/<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg">mg(1).</a> 
and hosted at <a href="https://www.vultr.com/">vultr</a> running <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8">httpd(8)</a> on <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>.
Previously iterations have happily lived at <strong>linode</strong> on <a href="https://www.debian.org/">debian</a> and at <a href="http://sdf.org">sdf</a></p>
