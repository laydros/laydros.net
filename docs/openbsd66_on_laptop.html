<h1><a name="top">Running OpenBSD 6.6
on your laptop is really hard (not)</a> </h1> 

<h3> Copied from <a href="https://sohcahtoa.org.uk/openbsd.html"> sohcahtoa.org.uk</a> incase it ever goes away - JWH</a>

<p>I have used the instructions in this page to install amd64 OpenBSD 
6.6 with the xfce4 desktop, graphical login, automatic mounting of USB 
sticks, with a basic set of applications on a Thinkpad L440 (legacy 
boot) laptop with 8 Gb RAM and a 200Gb SSD. Some of the links in this 
page relate to earlier versions of OpenBSD 6.x.</p>

<p>The L440 with 8Gb and an ssd is responsive. Battery life is an hour 
or two less than with a popular Linux distribution.</p>

<p>Below are some links to other pages about using 
OpenBSD on laptops.</p>

<ul>

<li><a 
href="https://www.c0ffee.net/blog/openbsd-on-a-laptop/">OpenBSD 
6.4 using the stock cwm window manager.</a> Does not specify make 
of laptop, does have an example of autojoin.</li>

<li><a 
href="http://bsdly.blogspot.co.uk/2017/07/openbsd-and-modern-laptop.html">More 
recent laptops are supported</a> - appears to have been updated for 6.4</li>

<li><a 
href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13223351">Alternative 
30 minute version with Lumina desktop</a> -Version 6.0 vintage but likely to work on later versions - just check 
<code>/etc/installurl</code> and use in preference to <code>PKG_PATH</code></li>

</ul>

<p>I suggest that you print and read this page before proceeding.</p>

<h2>Install OpenBSD according to the 
instructions in FAQ</h2> 

<p><strong>Background reading:</strong> <a 
href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.html" title="FAQ section 4 is the 
install guide">FAQ 4: The OpenBSD installation guide</a> and <a 
href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&m=157496600111772&w=2">useful 
mail list thread</a>.</p>

<p>The steps below assume that you have successfully installed the base 
OpenBSD system from the USB stick installer (<code>install66.fs</code>).</p>

<p>One thing to remember is that the installer is running from RAM and 
knows nothing about the USB drive you have plugged in. When you reach 
the part of the installation dialogue that asks you for the location of 
the sets (the system files to install) you have to specify [disk] and 
answer [No] when the script asks if the disk is mounted. The script will 
then list the available disks and ask you which one has the sets. The 
list will probably be something like [sd0 sd1] for an installation that 
is not using drive encryption and sd1 is likely to be your USB stick.</p>


<h2>Connect to the Internet</h2>

<p><strong>Background reading:</strong> OpenBSD FAQ <a 
href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq6.html#Setup.if">6.2.1</a>, <a 
href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq6.html#Wireless">6.13</a>.</p>

<p>Jack into your router with a cable and...</p>

<pre># dhclient em0
DHCPDISCOVER on em0 - interval 3
DHCPOFFER from 192.168.0.1 (00:1b:2f:42:41:42)
DHCPREQUEST on em0 to 255.255.255.255
DHCPACK from 192.168.0.1 (00:1b:2f:42:41:42)
bound to 192.168.0.4 -- renewal in 43200 seconds.
#</pre>

<p>Then install any non-free firmware that your laptop might need. The 
Thinkpad L440 required the wifi drivers, intel firmware and a couple of 
other files.</p>

<pre>
# fw_update
</pre>

<p>Pull the cable out and set up a wifi connection. Most Thinkpads have 
Intel wifi cards. The L440 uses the iwm0 driver (earlier Thinkpads used 
the iwn0 driver)</p>

<pre>$ su -l
# ifconfig -a # shows a list of all the interfaces 
# ifconfig iwm0 up
# ifconfig iwm0 scan
# ifconfig iwm0 nwid connection_name wpakey password wpaprotos wpa1,wpa2 
# dhclient iwm0 
DHCPREQUEST on iwm0 to 255.255.255.255 # lots more output
</pre>

<p><Strong>Warning</strong>: You need to use the <code>wpaprotos</code> 
option with argument <code>wpa1</code> to enable connections using 
<code>wpa1</code>. The <code>wpa1</code> protocol is now considered 
insecure.</p>

<h2>Use a hostname.if file to automatically join wifi 
networks</h2>

<p><strong>Background Reading:</strong> <a 
href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq6.html#Wireless">FAQ 
6 Configuring Your Wireless Adapter</a> section of 
Wireless Networking, <a 
href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/hostname.if">man 
<code>hostname.if</code></a>

<p>My <code>hostname.iwm0</code> file looks like this...</p>

<pre>
foo$ cat /etc/hostname.iwm0
# line below connects to my home wifi 
join myhomewifi wpakey wifi_password wpaprotos wpa1
# line below might connect to an open wifi [needs testing]
join Visitors_Library_of_Birmingham 
# line below requests IP address and DNS details using DHCP
dhcp
</pre>

<p>When experimenting with lines in your <code>hostname.iwm0</code> 
file, the commands below can be used to remove existing settings, and 
then restart networking without rebooting the machine...</p>

<pre>
# ifconfig iwm0 down
# pkill dhclient
# sh /etc/netstart
</pre>

<p>The kernel will use the <a 
href="https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20180712084645">auto-join 
algorithm</a> to pick a wifi access point to connect to if there is more 
than one in range when you start networking. You don't have to use a 
<code>hostname.if</code> file at all if you prefer to explicitly choose 
a wifi network to join (e.g a guest network at work instead of the 
authenticated one). You can just type in the commands each time you want 
to use a different wifi access point, or add some lines to 
<code>doas.conf</code> and use a little script from your user space to 
select which access point to use. I find that <code>hostname.if</code> 
fits my use case as I use just a few different and widely spaced 
locations.</p>

<h2>Set up a package mirror and install a 
package</h2> 

<p><strong>Background reading:</strong> OpenBSD FAQ <a 
href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html#PkgMgmt">15.2</a>.

</p><p>The <code>pkg_add</code> command reads the URL of the package 
mirror from the <code>/etc/installurl</code> file which is set to the 
OpenBSD content distribution network by default when installing version 
6.6</p>

<p>To install applications, you need to become root and run 
<code>pkg_add</code>.</p>

<pre>$ su -l
foo# pkg_add nano	# example from 6.5
quirks-3.124 signed on 2019-04-15T12:10:16Z
quirks-3.124: ok
nano-4.0:libiconv-1.14p3: ok
nano-4.0:gettext-0.19.8.1p3: ok
nano-4.0: ok
# exit
$
</pre>

<p>Once the command returns, exit root and try editing a text file with 
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2011/09/24/editor/">nano</a>.</p>

<h2>Install the xfce4 desktop environment and 
some applications</h2> 

<p>I like the xfce desktop and the packages below will install Firefox, 
a pdf reader, an image organiser, a music player and an office 
package.</p>

<pre># pkg_add -v consolekit2 xfce xfce-extras evince firefox shotwell audacious audacious-plugins libreoffice
</pre>

<p>The <code>consolekit2</code> package is needed to allow the user to 
shut down or reboot from within xfce4 without using terminal commands. 
</p>

<p><code>pkg_add</code> will stop when it reaches the document reader 
Evince and offer you a choice of two versions of the package, each 
compiled with different configuratons...</p>

<pre># pkg_add evince
quirks-2.114 signed on 2015-08-09T15:30:39Z
Ambiguous: choose package for evince
a       0: &lt;none&gt;
        1: evince-3.16.1p0
        2: evince-3.16.1p0-light
Your choice: 2
</pre>

<p>Option 1 will pull in a large number of Gnome libraries. Option 2 has 
been provided by the packager for those of us who wish to use Evince to 
read pdf files with a different desktop or window manager.</p>

<p>Some of the more complex packages come with <code>readme</code> files 
installed to <code>/usr/local/share/doc/pkg-readmes/</code>. It is best 
to read these to complete configuration of the package.</p>

<p>Don't reboot yet. You need to configure the graphical login and set 
up some daemons. See below...</p>

<h2>Use <code>/etc/rc.conf.local</code> to enable apmd and graphical 
log-in</h2>

<p><strong>Background reading:</strong> <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_X_Window_System_desktop_environments">Comparison 
of Desktop Environments</a>, <a 
href="https://github.com/ConsoleKit2/ConsoleKit2">ConsoleKit Github 
readme with definitions</a>, <a 
href="http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/xenodm">xenodm man page</a> and 
the package_readme for consolekit2 at 
<code>/usr/local/share/doc/pkg-readmes/consolekit2</code>. Note 
that as of OpenBSD 6.5, <a 
href="https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/%2Absd-17/openbsd-6-5-xorg-xfce4-start-failure-4175653099/">you 
can no longer start an X session using startx as a user</a>, you have to 
enable xenodm to start an X session.</p>

<p><strong>As root</strong> add some lines to 
<code>/etc/rc.conf.local</code> to enable power management 
(<code>apmd</code>) so that you can use Fn-F4 to suspend your thinkpad, 
and to enable the graphical log-in manager <code>xenodm</code>. Xenodm 
is an OpenBSD fork of the venerable <code>xdm</code>.</p>

<pre># nano /etc/rc.conf.local
multicast_host=YES       # Some avahi shenanigans
apmd_flags="-A"          # Laptop power saving
xenodm_flags=""          # Starts xenodm graphical login
pkg_scripts="messagebus" # Enables dbus/ConsoleKit stuff
</pre>

<p>Then <strong>as user</strong> add an <code>.xsession</code> file with 
a line that will start consolekit so that you can shutdown &amp;c from 
within xfce4.</p>

<pre>$ cat .xsession
exec ck-launch-session startxfce4</pre>

<p>From OpenBSD 6.5, you need to <a 
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/openbsd/comments/bnf1vp/xfce4_shutdown_acts_like_logout_openbsd_65/en5rk0o/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x">add 
your user to the operator group to be able to shutdown</a> from within 
xfce4...</p>

<pre>
# usermod -G operator $USER
</pre>

<p>...where you replace $USER with the name of your user account.</p>

<h3>Memory limits in <code>/etc/login.conf</code></h3>

<p>My Thinkpad L440 has 8Gb of RAM. Firefox (and Chromium) like lots of 
RAM. By default, OpenBSD enforces limits on the largest amount of RAM 
that a user level program can use to around 1.5Gb, and if it exceeds 
that limit, the OOM killer will terminate the process. Your user will be 
part of the <code>staff</code> group and you can edit <code>/etc/login.conf</code> to increase the default limit. Mine is set as 
follows...</p>

<pre>
#
# Staff have fewer restrictions and can login even when nologins are set.
#
staff:\
        :datasize-cur=4096M:\
        :datasize-max=infinity:\
        :maxproc-max=512:\
        :maxproc-cur=256:\
        :ignorenologin:\
        :requirehome@:\
        :tc=default:

</pre>

<p><strong>Reboot</strong> and you'll get the xenodm login greeter. When 
you log in, Xfce4 will ask you to specify a layout, and then show you 
the desktop.</p>

<h2>Use <code>/etc/doas.conf</code> to allow 
user mounting of an external USB stick</h2> 

<p><strong>Background reading:</strong> OpenBSD FAQ sections <a 
href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq10.html#doas">10 (doas)</a>, <a 
href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq14.html">14 (File Systems Intro)</a> 
as well as <code>man doas</code> and <code>man mount</code>.</p>

<p>You must use <code>doas</code> and a few lines in 
<code>/etc/doas.conf</code> to allow user mounting of USB sticks. My 
<code>/etc/doas.conf</code> file looks like this...</p>

<pre>$ cat /etc/doas.conf
# http://daemonforums.org/showthread.php?t=9774
permit nopass keith as root cmd mount
permit nopass keith as root cmd umount
</pre>

<p>Then you can mount a USB stick like this...</p>

<pre>
$ mkdir ~/usb				# make a directory to mount to
$ doas mount /dev/sd1i /home/keith/usb 	# mounts my USB on ~/usb
</pre>

<p>The mount command tells me what partitions and disks are mounted...</p>

<pre>$ mount
/dev/sd0a on / type ffs (local)
/dev/sd0k on /home type ffs (local, nodev, nosuid)
/dev/sd0d on /tmp type ffs (local, nodev, nosuid)
/dev/sd0f on /usr type ffs (local, nodev)
/dev/sd0g on /usr/X11R6 type ffs (local, nodev)
/dev/sd0h on /usr/local type ffs (local, nodev, wxallowed)
/dev/sd0j on /usr/obj type ffs (local, nodev, nosuid)
/dev/sd0i on /usr/src type ffs (local, nodev, nosuid)
/dev/sd0e on /var type ffs (local, nodev, nosuid)
/dev/sd1i on /home/keith/usb type msdos (local, uid=1000, gid=1000)
</pre>

<p>Once mounted, you can use a graphical file manager like Thunar to 
copy and paste files to and from your storage stick. You can't unmount 
the USB stick from Thunar, remember to use the <code>umount 
/dev/sd1i</code> command before removing the USB stick...</p>

<pre>
doas umount /dev/sd1i 			# un-mounts the drive
</pre>

<h2>Use <code>xfce4-mount-plugin</code> and an <code>/etc/fstab</code> 
entry to allow graphical mount/unmount of a USB thumb drive</h2>

<p><strong>Background reading:</strong> <a 
href="http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/panel-plugins/xfce4-mount-plugin">xfce4-mount-plugin 
page on the Xfce Web site</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A note on how disks get numbered</strong>: There are two 
possibilities for a simple installation on a laptop with a single main 
hard drive...</p>

<ul>

<li>Unencrypted hard drive: you probably have OpenBSD installed to the 
internal hard drive with number <code>sd0</code>. Your USB stick will be 
recognised as <code>sd1</code>.</li>

<li>Whole disk encryption: the internal hard drive will be 
<code>sd0</code> but you will have installed OpenBSD to a softraid 
device numbered <code>sd1</code>. So your USB stick will be recognised 
as <code>sd2</code>.</li>

</ul>

<p>The rest of this section assumes that you have an OpenBSD install on 
<code>sd0</code>. Just increase the drive numbers by 1 for an 
installation using whole drive encryption.</p>

<p>The <code>xfce4-mount</code> package is installed as part of the <code>xfce4</code> package set. <strong>Add</strong> an icon for the 
plugin to the XFCE4 
panel by right-clicking on the panel and selecting 
<strong>Panel | Add New Items</strong> and searching for 'mount'.</p>

<p>By default, <code>xfce4-mount-plugin</code> lists all the devices 
including the default local hard drive including all the partitions on 
<code>sd0</code>. I can set options to prevent that and to use a custom mount 
command. Right click over the xfce4-mount icon and <strong>select 
Properties | File Systems</strong> tab. Add the pattern 
<code>/dev/sd0*</code> to the Exclude specified file systems textbox so 
the local drive is not listed.</p>

<p>Right-click on the xfce4-mount icon, and selected <strong>Preferences 
| Commands</strong> and write the following in the Custom Commands 
textboxes, after ensuring that the Custom Commands checkbox was 
ticked...</p>

<pre>doas mount %m
doas umount %m
</pre>

<p>Now to ensure that a USB stick is <em>listed</em> in the 
xfce4-mount-popup list, you have to add a line for the device to 
<code>/etc/fstab</code>. My extra line looks like this (adapted from the 
examples in <code>man fstab</code>...</p>

<pre>/dev/sd1i /home/keith/usb msdos rw,noauto 0 0
</pre>

<p>Using an <code>fstab</code> entry like this means that only one vfat 
formatted USB thumb drive will be listed and available with mouse 
clicks.</p>

<h2>Set up updates</h2>


<p><strong>Background reading:</strong> pages about <a 
href="http://www.openbsd.org/stable.html">following the 
<code>-stable</code> branch</a> and the <a 
href="https://www.openbsd.org/errata66.html">OpenBSD 6.6 Errata</a>

<p>M:Tier sponsors OpenBSD and has provided <code>binpatches</code> for 
the packages in the stable release for use together with the 
<code>openup</code> script. They recommend using <code>openup</code> to 
upgrade packages that you have installed in addition to the base 
system. I have yet to try <code>openup</code> on OpenBSD 6.6</p>

<h2>Install OpenBSD with whole drive encryption (advanced) (not tried on 
6.6 yet)</h2>

</p><p><strong>Background reading</strong>: OpenBSD FAQ sections <a 
href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq14.html#intro">14.1</a>, <a 
href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq14.html#fdisk">14.2</a> and <a 
href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq14.html#disklabel">14.3</a>.</p>

<p>In OpenBSD 6.4 I used the <a 
href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq14.html#softraidFDE">commands 
detailed in the FAQ</a> to create an encrypted softraid device and then 
install OpenBSD within that device. I omitted the command to over-write 
the disk with random numbers because of time.</p>

<p>Because I install from a USB stick, the drive numbering is 'off by 
one' compared to the example commands in the FAQ, so the fixed disk in 
the laptop is sd0 and the USB stick that I am installing from is sd1. 
The softraid device I install OpenBSD to is therefore sd2. The 
commands I actually used in the installer shell session are shown 
below.</p>

<p>Boot from the installer USB stick and then select 
<code>[S]hell</code> to get a command prompt...</p>

<pre>
# fdisk -iy sd0		# MBR not GPT
# disklabel -E sd0
>a a
offset:[64]
size:[the size of your drive]
FS type:[4.2BSD] RAID
>w
>q
No label changes
# bioctl -c C -l sd0a softraid0
New pass phrase:
re-type passphrase
# cd /dev && sh MAKEDEV sd2
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rsd2c bs=1m count=1
# exit
</pre>

<p>The <code>exit</code> command starts the installer script and you 
type in the root password, your user and the user password and so on. 
Then you select <code>sd2</code> as the disk to install to. You also 
have to specify <code>[disk]</code> as the location of the package sets 
and then answer 'no' when asked if the disk is mounted, select 
<code>sd1</code>, mount the <code>a</code> partition. The installer 
script should then find the package sets.</p>

<p>When you reboot into the new installation, you will be asked to enter 
the pass phrase for the encrypted disk, and then OpenBSD should show the 
usual boot dialogue. You will see a message about renumbering the 
operating system disk as <code>sd1</code>, because the USB stick I 
installed from has been removed. The <code>/etc/fstab</code> file shows 
UUIDs for each partition, so the boot loader can find the 
partitions.</p>
