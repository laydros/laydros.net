These are a couple of the docs that started the whole "lifehacks" thing. They were influential to people like Gina Trampani, Merlin Mann, and Corey Doctrow, who were influential to me.
I've just copied these from Corey Doctrow's site so I can find them later.
<ul>
<li><a href="lifehacksetcon04.txt">Life Hacks: Tech Secrets of Overprolific Geeks</a></li>
<li><a href="lifehacks2.txt">Notes from Danny O'Brien's NotCon Recap of Life Hacks</a></li>
</ul>
