<P>UNIX is an extremely popular platform for deploying server software
partly because of its security and stability, but also because it has
a rich set of command line and scripting tools.  Programmers use these
tools for manipulating the file system, processing log files, and
generally automating as much as possible.

<P>If you want to be a serious server developer, you will need to have a
certain facility with a number of UNIX tools; about 15.  You will
start to see similarities among them, particularly regular
expressions, and soon you will feel very comfortable.  Combining the
simple commands, you can build very powerful tools very quickly--much
faster than you could build the equivalent functionality in C or Java,
for example.

<P>This lecture takes you through the basic commands and then shows you
how to combine them in simple patterns or idioms to provide
sophisticated functionality like histogramming.  This lecture assumes
you know what a shell is and that you have some basic familiarity with
UNIX.

<P> [By the way, this page gets a lot of attention on the net and
unfortunately I get mail from lots of people that have better
solutions or stuff I should add.  I'm only showing what I've learned
from watching good UNIX people so I am not saying these tips are the
optimal solutions.  I'd make a pretty ignorant sys admin.]
<H2>Everything is a stream</H2>


<P>The first thing you need to know is that UNIX is based upon the idea
of a <em>stream</em>.  Everything is a <em>stream</em>, or appears to be.  Device
drivers look like streams, terminals look like streams, processes
communicate via streams, etc...  The input and output of a program are
streams that you can redirect into a device, a file, or another
program.

<P>Here is an example device, the null device, that lets you throw output away.  For example, you might want to run a program but ignore the output.

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ ls &gt; /dev/null # ignore output of ls
</PRE></FONT>



<P>where "<TT># ignore output of ls</TT>" is a comment.

<P>Most of the commands covered in this lecture process <TT>stdin</TT> and send results to <TT>stdout</TT>.  In this manner, you can incrementally process a data stream by hooking the output of one tool to the input of another via a <em>pipe</em>.  For example, the following piped sequence prints the number of files in the current directory modified in August.

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ ls -l | grep Aug | wc -l
</PRE></FONT>



<P>Imagine how long it would take you to write the equivalent C or Java program.  You can become an extremely productive UNIX programmer if you learn to combine the simple command-line tools.  Even when programming on a PC, I use MKS's UNIX shell and command library to make it look like a UNIX box.  Worth the cash.
<H2>Getting help</H2>


<P>If you need to know about a command, ask for the "man" page.  For example, to find out about the <TT>ls</TT> command, type

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ man ls
LS(1)                   System General Commands Manual                   LS(1)

NAME
     ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
     ls [-ACFLRSTWacdfgiklnoqrstux1] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, ls
...
</PRE></FONT>



<P>You will get a summary of the command and any arguments.

<P>If you cannot remember the command's name, try using <TT>apropos</TT> which finds commands and library routines related to that word.  For example, to find out how to do checksums, type

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ apropos checksum
cksum(1), sum(1)         - display file checksums and block counts
md5(1)                   - calculate a message-digest fingerprint (checksum) for a file
</PRE></FONT>


<H2>Special Directories and files</H2>


<P>See @<A HREF="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/09/linux-file-system-structure"><B>http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/09/linux-file-system-structure</B></A>

<P>A shortcut for you home directory, <TT>/home/</TT><em>username</em>, is
<TT>~</TT><em>username</em>.  For example, <TT>~parrt</TT> is my home directory,
<TT>/home/parrt</TT>.

<P>When you are using the shell, there is the notion of <em>current
directory</em>.  The dot '<TT>.</TT>' character is a shorthand for the current
directory and '<TT>..</TT>' is a shorthand for the directory above the
current.  So to access file <TT>test</TT> in the current directory, <TT>./test</TT>
is the same as plain <TT>test</TT>.  If <TT>test</TT> is a directory above, use
<TT>../test</TT>.

<P><TT>/</TT> is the root directory; there is no drive specification in UNIX.

<P>The <TT>.bash_profile</TT> file is very important as it is how your shell
session is initialized including your ever-important <TT>CLASSPATH</TT>
environment variable.  Your <TT>bash</TT> shell initialization file is
<TT>~</TT><em>username</em><TT>/.bash_profile</TT> and has set up code like the following:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
</PRE></FONT>



<P>Typically, you will go in and set your <TT>CLASSPATH</TT> so that you don't
have to set it all the time.

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
export CLASSPATH=".:/home/public/cs601/junit.jar"
</PRE></FONT>



<P>The <TT>export</TT> means that the assignment to <TT>CLASSPATH</TT> is visible to
all child processes (that is, visible to all programs you run from the
shell).
<H2>The basics</H2>

<H3>cd</H3>


<P>Changing a directory is done with <TT>cd</TT> <em>dir</em> where <em>dir</em> can be "." or
".." to move to current directory (do nothing) or go up a directory.
<H3>ls</H3>


<P>Display files in a directory with <TT>ls</TT>.  The <TT>-l</TT> option is used to
display details of the files:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
total 9592
-rw-r--r--    1 parrt  staff     5600 Aug 19  2005 C-Java-relationship.html
...
drwxr-xr-x   13 parrt  staff      442 Oct 19  2005 sessions
-rw-r--r--    1 parrt  staff     2488 Oct 19  2005 sessions.html
...
</PRE></FONT>



<P>"staff" is parrt's group.

<P>If you want to see hidden files (those starting with "."), use "-a".

<P>Combinations are possible: use "ls -la" to see details of all files
including hidden ones.
<H3>displaying files</H3>


<P>There are 4 useful ways to display the contents or portions of a file.
The first is the very commonly used command <TT>cat</TT>.  For example, to
display my list of object-oriented keywords used in this course, type:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ cat /home/public/cs601/oo.keywords.txt
</PRE></FONT>



<P>If a file is really big, you will probably want to use <TT>more</TT>, which
spits the file out in screen-size chunks.

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ more /var/log/mail.log
</PRE></FONT>



<P>If you only want to see the first few lines of a file or the last few
lines use <TT>head</TT> and <TT>tail</TT>.

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ head /var/log/mail.log
$ tail /var/log/mail.log
</PRE></FONT>



<P>You can specify a number as an argument to get a specific number of lines:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ head -30 /var/log/mail.log
</PRE></FONT>



<P>The most useful incantation of <TT>tail</TT> prints the last few lines of a
file and then waits, printing new lines as they are appended to the
file.  This is great for watching a log file:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ tail -f /var/log/mail.log
</PRE></FONT>



<P>If you need to know how many characters, words, or lines are in a
file, use <TT>wc</TT>:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ wc /var/log/mail.log
     164    2916   37896 /var/log/mail.log
</PRE></FONT>



<P>Where the numbers are, in order, lines, words, then characters.  For
clarity, you can use <TT>wc -l</TT> to print just the number of lines.
<H3>pushd, popd</H3>


<P>Instead of <TT>cd</TT> you can use <TT>pushd</TT> to save the current dir and then automatically <TT>cd</TT> to the specified directory.  For example, 

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ pwd
/Users/parrt
$ pushd /tmp
/tmp ~
$ pwd
/tmp
$ popd
~
$ pwd
/Users/parrt
</PRE></FONT>


<H3>top</H3>


<P>To watch a dynamic display of the processes on your box in action, use <TT>top</TT>.
<H3>ps</H3>


<P>To print out (wide display) all processes running on a box, use <TT>ps auxwww</TT>.
<H3>chmod</H3>


<P>To change the privileges of a file or directory, use <TT>chmod</TT>.  The
privileges are 3 digit octal words with 3 bits per digit: rwxrwxrwx
where the first digit is for the file owner, the 2nd for the group,
and 3rd for anybody.  644 is a common word value file which means
110100100 or rw-r--r--.  When you do <TT>ls -l</TT> you will see these
bits. 755 is a common word value for directories: rwxr-xr-x where
directories need to be executable for <TT>cd</TT> to be able to enter that
dir. 755 is a shorthand for the more readable argument <TT>u=rwx,go=rx</TT>.
u is user, g is group, o is other.

<P>Use <TT>chmod -R</TT> for recursively applying to all the dirs below the
argument as well.

<P>
<H2>Searching streams</H2>


<P>One of the most useful tools available on UNIX and the one you may use the most is <TT>grep</TT>.  This tool matches regular expressions (which includes simple words) and prints matching lines to <TT>stdout</TT>.

<P>The simplest incantation looks for a particular character sequence in a set of files.  Here is an example that looks for any reference to <TT>System</TT> in the java files in the current directory.

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
grep System *.java
</PRE></FONT>



<P>You may find the dot '.' regular expression useful.  It matches any
single character but is typically combined with the star, which
matches zero or more of the preceding item.  Be careful to enclose the
expression in single quotes so the command-line expansion doesn't
modify the argument.  The following example, looks for references to
any a forum page in a server log file:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ grep '/forum/.*' /home/public/cs601/unix/access.log
</PRE></FONT>



<P>or equivalently:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ cat /home/public/cs601/unix/access.log | grep '/forum/.*' 
</PRE></FONT>



<P>The second form is useful when you want to process a collection of files as a single stream as in:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
cat /home/public/cs601/unix/access*.log | grep '/forum/.*'
</PRE></FONT>



<P>If you need to look for a string at the beginning of a line, use caret '^':

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ grep '^195.77.105.200' /home/public/cs601/unix/access*.log
</PRE></FONT>



<P>This finds all lines in all access logs that begin with IP address
195.77.105.200.

<P>If you would like to invert the pattern matching to find lines that do not match a pattern, use <TT>-v</TT>.  Here is an example that finds references to non image <TT>GET</TT>s in a log file:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ cat /home/public/cs601/unix/access.log | grep -v '/images'
</PRE></FONT>



<P>Now imagine that you have an http log file and you would like to filter out page requests made by nonhuman spiders.  If you have a file called <TT>spider.IPs</TT>, you can find all nonspider page views via:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ cat /home/public/cs601/unix/access.log | grep -v -f /tmp/spider.IPs
</PRE></FONT>



<P>Finally, to ignore the case of the input stream, use <TT>-i</TT>.
<H2>Translating streams</H2>


<P>Morphing a text stream is a fundamental UNIX operation.  PERL is a good tool for this, but since I don't like PERL I stick with three tools: <TT>tr</TT>, <TT>sed</TT>, and <TT>awk</TT>.  PERL and these tools are line-by-line tools in that they operate well only on patterns fully contained within a single line.  If you need to process more complicated patterns like XML or you need to parse a programming language, use a context-free grammar tool like <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org"><B> ANTLR</B></A>.
<H3>tr</H3>


<P>For manipulating whitespace, you will find <TT>tr</TT> very useful.

<P>If you have columns of data separated by spaces and you would like the columns to collapse so there is a single column of data, tell <TT>tr</TT> to replace space with newline <TT>tr ' ' '\n'</TT>.  Consider input file <TT>/home/public/cs601/unix/names</TT>:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
jim scott mike
bill randy tom
</PRE></FONT>



<P>To get all those names in a column, use

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ cat /home/public/cs601/unix/names | tr ' ' '\n'
</PRE></FONT>



<P>If you would like to collapse all sequences of spaces into one single space, use <TT>tr -s ' '</TT>.

<P>To convert a PC file to UNIX, you have to get rid of the '\r' characters.  Use <TT>tr -d '\r'</TT>.
<H3>sed</H3>


<P>If dropping or translating single characters is not enough, you can
use <TT>sed</TT> (stream editor) to replace or delete text chunks matched by
regular expressions.  For example, to delete all references to word
<TT>scott</TT> in the names file from above, use

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ cat /home/public/cs601/unix/names | sed 's/scott//'
</PRE></FONT>



<P>which substitutes <TT>scott</TT> for nothing.  If there are multiple references to <TT>scott</TT> on a single line, use the <TT>g</TT> suffix to indicate "global" on that line otherwise only the first occurrence will be removed:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ ... | sed 's/scott//g'
</PRE></FONT>



<P>If you would like to replace references to <TT>view.jsp</TT> with <TT>index.jsp</TT>, use

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ ... | sed 's/view.jsp/index.jsp/'
</PRE></FONT>



<P>If you want any <TT>.asp</TT> file converted to <TT>.jsp</TT>, you must match the file name with a regular expression and refer to it via <TT>\1</TT>:
 

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ ... | sed 's/\(.*\).asp/\1.jsp/'
</PRE></FONT>



<P>The <TT>\(...\)</TT> grouping collects text that you can refer to with <TT>\1</TT>.

<P>If you want to kill everything from the ',' character to end of line, use the end-of-line marker <TT>$</TT>:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ ... | sed 's/,.*$//' # kill from comma to end of line
</PRE></FONT>


<H3>awk</H3>


<P>When you need to work with columns of data or execute a little bit of code for each line matching a pattern, use <TT>awk</TT>.  <TT>awk</TT> programs are pattern-action pairs.  While some <TT>awk</TT> programs are complicated enough to require a separate file containing the program, you can do some amazing things using an argument on the command-line.

<P><TT>awk</TT> thinks input lines are broken up into fields (i.e., columns) separate by whitespace.  Fields are referenced in an action via <TT>$1</TT>, <TT>$2</TT>, ... while <TT>$0</TT> refers to the entire input line.

<P>A pattern-action pair looks like:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
pattern {action}
</PRE></FONT>



<P>If you omit the pattern, the action is executed for each input line.  Omitting the action means print the line.  You can separate the pairs by newline or semicolon.

<P>Consider input

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
aasghar Asghar, Ali
wchen   Chen, Wei
zchen   Chen, Zhen-Jian
</PRE></FONT>



<P>If you want a list of login names, ask <TT>awk</TT> to print the first column:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ cat /home/public/cs601/unix/emails.txt | awk '{print $1;}'
</PRE></FONT>

 

<P>If you want to convert the login names to email addresses, use the <TT>printf</TT> C-lookalike function:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ cat /home/public/cs601/unix/emails.txt | awk '{printf("%s@cs.usfca.edu,",$1);}'
</PRE></FONT>



<P>Because of the missing <TT>\n</TT> in the <TT>printf</TT> string, you'll see the output all on one line ready for pasting into a mail program: 

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
aasghar@cs.usfca.edu,wchen@cs.usfca.edu,zchen@cs.usfca.edu
</PRE></FONT>



<P>You might also want to reorder columns of data.  To print firstname, lastname, you might try:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ cat /home/public/cs601/unix/emails.txt | awk '{printf("%s %s\n", $3, $2);}'
</PRE></FONT>



<P>but you'll notice that the comma is still there as it is part of the column:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
Ali Asghar,
Wei Chen,
Zhen-Jian Chen,
</PRE></FONT>



<P>You need to pipe the output thru <TT>tr</TT> (or <TT>sed</TT>) to strip the comma:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ cat /home/public/cs601/unix/emails.txt | \
  awk '{printf("%s %s\n", $3, $2);}' | \
  tr -d ','
</PRE></FONT>



<P>Then you will see:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
Ali Asghar
Wei Chen
Zhen-Jian Chen
</PRE></FONT>



<P>You can also use <TT>awk</TT> to examine the value of content.  To sum up the first column of the following data (in file <TT>/home/public/cs601/unix/coffee</TT>):

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
3 parrt
2 jcoker
8 tombu
</PRE></FONT>



<P>use the following simple command:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ awk '{n+=$1;} ; END {print n;}' &lt; /home/public/cs601/unix/coffee
</PRE></FONT>



<P>where <TT>END</TT> is a special pattern that means "after processing the stream."

<P>If you want to filter or sum all values less than or equal to, say 3, use an <TT>if</TT> statement:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ awk '{if ($1&lt;=3) n+=$1;} END {print n;}' &lt; /home/public/cs601/unix/coffee
</PRE></FONT>



<P>In this case, you will see output <TT>5</TT> (3+2);

<P>Using <TT>awk</TT> to grab a particular column is very common when processing log files.  Consider a <A HREF="http://www.jguru.com"><B>http://www.jguru.com</B></A> page view log file, <TT>/home/public/cs601/unix/pageview-20021022.log</TT>, that are of the form:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
date-stamp(thread-name): userID-or-IPaddr URL site-section
</PRE></FONT>



<P>So, the data looks like this:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>

<P>When a user is logged in, the log file has their user ID rather than their IP address.

<P>Here is how you get a list of URLs that people view on say October 22, 2002:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ awk '{print $3;}' &lt; /home/public/cs601/unix/pageview-20021022.log
/faq/subtopic.jsp?topicID=472&page=2
/index.jsp
/faq/subtopic.jsp?topicID=364
/faq/view.jsp?EID=736437

/faq/view.jsp?EID=225150
/forums/most_active.jsp?topic=EJB
/guru/edit_account.jsp
/misc/login.jsp
...
</PRE></FONT>



<P>If you want to count how many page views there were that day that were not processing pages (my processing pages are all of the form <TT>process_</TT><em>xxx</em>), pipe the results through <TT>grep</TT> and <TT>wc</TT>:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ awk '{print $3;}' &lt; /home/public/cs601/unix/pageview-20021022.log | \
  grep -v process | \
  wc -l
67850
</PRE></FONT>



<P>If you want a unique list of URLs, you can sort the output and then use <TT>uniq</TT>:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ awk '{print $3;}' &lt; /home/public/cs601/unix/pageview-20021022.log | \
  sort | \
  uniq
</PRE></FONT>



<P><TT>uniq</TT> just collapses all repeated lines into a single line--that is why you must sort the output first.  You'll get output like:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
/article/index.jsp
/article/index.jsp?page=1
/article/index.jsp?page=10
/article/index.jsp?page=2
...
</PRE></FONT>


<H2>Tarballs</H2>


<P>Note: <em>The name comes from a similar word, hairball (stuff that cats throw up), I'm pretty sure</em>.

<P>To collect a bunch of files and directories together, use <TT>tar</TT>.  For example, to tar up your entire home directory and put the tarball into <TT>/tmp</TT>, do this

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ cd ~parrt
$ cd .. # go one dir above dir you want to tar
$ tar cvf /tmp/parrt.backup.tar parrt
</PRE></FONT>



<P>By convention, use <TT>.tar</TT> as the extension.  To untar this file use

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ cd /tmp
$ tar xvf parrt.backup.tar
</PRE></FONT>



<P><TT>tar</TT> untars things in the <B>current</B> directory!

<P>After running the untar, you will find a new directory, <TT>/tmp/parrt</TT>, that is a copy of your home directory.  Note that the way you tar things up dictates the directory structure when untarred.  The fact that I mentioned <TT>parrt</TT> in the tar creation means that I'll have that dir when untarred.  In contrast, the following will also make a copy of my home directory, but without having a <TT>parrt</TT> root dir:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ cd ~parrt
$ tar cvf /tmp/parrt.backup.tar *
</PRE></FONT>



<P>It is a good idea to tar things up with a root directory so that when you untar you don't generate a million files in the current directly.  To see what's in a tarball, use

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ tar tvf /tmp/parrt.backup.tar
</PRE></FONT>



<P>Most of the time you can save space by using the <TT>z</TT> argument.  The tarball will then be <TT>gzip</TT>'d and you should use file extension <TT>.tar.gz</TT>:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ cd ~parrt
$ cd .. # go one dir above dir you want to tar
$ tar cvfz /tmp/parrt.backup.tar.gz parrt
</PRE></FONT>



<P>Unzipping requires the <TT>z</TT> argument also:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ cd /tmp

<P>If you have a big file to compress, use <TT>gzip</TT>:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ gzip bigfile
</PRE></FONT>



<P>After execution, your file will have been renamed <TT>bigfile.gz</TT>.  To uncompress, use 

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ gzip -d bigfile.gz
</PRE></FONT>



<P>To display a text file that is currently <TT>gzip</TT>'d, use <TT>zcat</TT>:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ zcat bigfile.gz

<H2>Moving files between machines</H2>

<H3>rsync</H3>


<P>When you need to have a directory on one machine mirrored on another machine, use <TT>rsync</TT>.  It compares all the files in a directory subtree and copies over any that have changed to the mirrored directory on the other machine.  For example, here is how you could "pull" all logs files from <TT>livebox.jguru.com</TT> to the box from which you execute the <TT>rsync</TT> command:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ hostname
jazz.jguru.com
$ rsync -rabz -e ssh -v 'parrt@livebox.jguru.com:/var/log/jguru/*' \
  /backup/web/logs
</PRE></FONT>



<P><TT>rsync</TT> will delete or truncate files to ensure the files stay the same.  This is bad if you erase a file by mistake--it will wipe out your backup file.  Add an argument called <TT>--suffix</TT> to tell <TT>rsync</TT> to make a copy of any existing file before it overwrites it:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ hostname
jazz.jguru.com
$ rsync -rabz -e ssh -v --suffix .rsync_`date '+%Y%m%d'` \
 'parrt@livebox.jguru.com:/var/log/jguru/*' /backup/web/logs
</PRE></FONT>



<P>where <TT>`date '+%Y%m%d'`</TT> (in reverse single quotes) means "execute this <TT>date</TT> command".

<P>To exclude certain patterns from the sync, use <TT>--exclude</TT>:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ rsync -rabz --exclude=entitymanager/ --suffix .rsync_`date '+%Y%m%d'` \
  -e ssh -v 'parrt@livebox.jguru.com:/var/log/jguru/*' /backup/web/logs
</PRE></FONT>


<H3>scp</H3>


<P>To copy a file or directory manually, use <TT>scp</TT>:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ scp lecture.html parrt@nexus.cs.usfca.edu:~parrt/lectures
</PRE></FONT>



<P>Just like <TT>cp</TT>, use <TT>-r</TT> to copy a directory recursively.
<H2>Miscellaneous</H2>

<H3>find</H3>


<P>Most GUIs for Linux or PCs have a search facility, but from the command-line you can use <TT>find</TT>.  To find all files named <TT>.p4</TT> starting in directory <TT>~/antlr/depot/projects</TT>, use:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ find  ~/antlr/depot/projects -name '.p4'
</PRE></FONT>



<P>The default "action" is to <TT>-print</TT>.

<P>You can specify a regular expression to match.  For example, to look under your home directory for any xml files, use:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ find ~ -name '*.xml' -print
</PRE></FONT>



<P>Note the use of the single quotes to prevent command-line expansion--you want the '*' to go to the <TT>find</TT> command.

<P>You can execute a command for every file or directory found that matches a name.  For example, do delete all xml files, do this:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ find ~ -name '*.xml' -exec rm {} \;
</PRE></FONT>



<P>where "{}" stands for "current file that matches".  The end of the command must be terminated with ';' but because of the command-line expansion, you'll need to escape the ';'.

<P>You can also specify time information in your query.  Here is a shell script that uses <TT>find</TT> to delete all files older than 14 days.

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
#!/bin/sh

BACKUP_DIR=/var/data/backup

# number of days to keep backups
AGE=14 # days
AGE_MINS=$[ $AGE * 60 * 24 ]

# delete dirs/files
find $BACKUP_DIR/* -cmin +$AGE_MINS -type d -exec rm -rf {} \;
</PRE></FONT>



<P>Use find in back ticks as an argument:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
vi `find . -name '*.java'` # open all java files below current dir
</PRE></FONT>


<H3>fuser</H3>


<P>If you want to know who is using a port such as HTTP (80), use <TT>fuser</TT>.  You must be root to use this:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ sudo /sbin/fuser -n tcp 80
80/tcp:              13476 13477 13478 13479 13480
13481 13482 13483 13484 13486 13487 13489 13490 13491
13492 13493 13495 13496 13497 13498 13499 13500 13501 13608
</PRE></FONT>



<P>The output indicates the list of processes associated with that port.
<H3>whereis</H3>


<P>Sometimes you want to use a command but it's not in your <TT>PATH</TT> and you can't remember where it is.  Use <TT>whereis</TT> to look in standard unix locations for the command.

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ whereis fuser
fuser: /sbin/fuser /usr/man/man1/fuser.1 /usr/man/man1/fuser.1.gz
$ whereis ls   
ls: /bin/ls /usr/man/man1/ls.1 /usr/man/man1/ls.1.gz
</PRE></FONT>



<P><TT>whereis</TT> also shows <TT>man</TT> pages.
<H3>which</H3>


<P>Sometimes you might be executing the wrong version of a command and you want to know which version of the command your <TT>PATH</TT> indicates should be run. Use <TT>which</TT> to ask:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ which ls
alias ls='ls --color=tty'
        /bin/ls
$ which java
/usr/local/java/bin/java
</PRE></FONT>



<P>If nothing is found in your path, you'll see:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ which fuser
/usr/bin/which: no fuser in (/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/java/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/home/parrt/bin)
</PRE></FONT>


<H3>kill</H3>


<P>To send a signal to a process, use <TT>kill</TT>.  Typically you'll want to just say <TT>kill pid</TT> where <TT>pid</TT> can be found from <TT>ps</TT> or <TT>top</TT> (see below).

<P>Use <TT>kill -9 pid</TT> when you can't get the process to die; this means kill it with "extreme prejudice".
<H3>traceroute</H3>


<P>If you are having trouble getting to a site, use <TT>traceroute</TT> to watch the sequence of hops used to get to a site:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ /usr/sbin/traceroute www.cnn.com

<H2>Useful combinations</H2>

<H3>How to kill a set of processes</H3>


<P>If you want to kill all <TT>java</TT> processes running for <TT>parrt</TT>, you can
either run <TT>killall java</TT> if you are <TT>parrt</TT> or generate a "kill"
script via:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ ps auxwww|grep java|grep parrt|awk '{print "kill -9 ",$2;}' &gt; /tmp/killparrt
$ bash /tmp/killparrt # run resulting script
</PRE></FONT>



<P>The <TT>/tmp/killparrt</TT> file would look something like:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
kill -9 1021
kill -9 1023
kill -9 1024
</PRE></FONT>



<P>Note: you can also do this common task with:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ killall java
</PRE></FONT>



<P>Please be aware that this is linux specific; i'm told that it will kill all processing on UNIXen like Solaris!
<H3>How to make a histogram</H3>


<P>A histogram is set of count, value pairs indicating how often the value occurs.  The basic operation will be to sort, then count how many values occur in a row and then reverse sort so that the value with the highest count is at the top of the report.

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ ... | sort |uniq -c|sort -r -n 
</PRE></FONT>



<P>Note that <TT>sort</TT> sorts on the whole line, but the first column is obviously significant just as the first letter in someone's last name significantly positions their name in a sorted list.

<P><TT>uniq -c</TT> collapses all repeated sequences of values but prints the number of occurrences in front of the value.  Recall the previous sorting:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ awk '{print $3;}' &lt; /home/public/cs601/unix/pageview-20021022.log | \
  sort | \
  uniq
/article/index.jsp
/article/index.jsp?page=1
/article/index.jsp?page=10
/article/index.jsp?page=2
...
</PRE></FONT>



<P>Now add <TT>-c</TT> to <TT>uniq</TT>:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ awk '{print $3;}' &lt; /home/public/cs601/unix/pageview-20021022.log | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c
 623 /article/index.jsp
   6 /article/index.jsp?page=1
  10 /article/index.jsp?page=10
 109 /article/index.jsp?page=2
...
</PRE></FONT>



<P>Now all you have to do is reverse sort the lines according to the first column numerically.

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ awk '{print $3;}' &lt; /home/public/cs601/unix/pageview-20021022.log | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -r -n
6170 /index.jsp
2916 /search/results.jsp
1397 /faq/index.jsp
1018 /forums/index.jsp
 884 /faq/home.jsp?topic=Tomcat
...
</PRE></FONT>



<P>In practice, you might want to get a histogram that has been "despidered" and only has faq related views.  You can filter out all page view lines associated with spider IPs and filter in only faq lines:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ grep -v -f /tmp/spider.IPs /home/public/cs601/unix/pageview-20021022.log | \
  awk '{print $3;}'| \
  grep '/faq' | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -r -n
1397 /faq/index.jsp
 884 /faq/home.jsp?topic=Tomcat
 525 /faq/home.jsp?topic=Struts
 501 /faq/home.jsp?topic=JSP
 423 /faq/home.jsp?topic=EJB
...
</PRE></FONT>



<P>If you want to only see despidered faq pages that were referenced more than 500 times, add an <TT>awk</TT> command to the end.

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$ grep -v -f /tmp/spider.IPs /home/public/cs601/unix/pageview-20021022.log | \
  awk '{print $3;}'| \
  grep '/faq' | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -r -n | \
  awk '{if ($1&gt;500) print $0;}'
1397 /faq/index.jsp
 884 /faq/home.jsp?topic=Tomcat
 525 /faq/home.jsp?topic=Struts
 501 /faq/home.jsp?topic=JSP

<H3>Generating Java class hierarchy diagrams</H3>


<P>A student asked if I knew of a program that generated class hierarchy
diagrams.  I said "no", but then realized we don't need one.  Here's
the one liner to do it:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
# pulls out superclass and class as $5 and $3:
# public class A extends B ...
# only works for public classes and usual formatting
cat *.java | grep 'public class' $1 | \
    awk 'BEGIN {print "digraph foo {";} {print $5 "-&gt;" $3;} END {print "}"}'
</PRE></FONT>



<P>It generates <A HREF="www.graphviz.org"><B>DOT</B></A> format graph files.  Try it.
It's amazing.  Works for most cases.  Output looks like:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
digraph foo {
antlr.CharScanner-&gt;JavaLexer
antlr.LLkParser-&gt;Mantra
-&gt;TestLexer
}

<H3>Generating scripts and programs</H3>


<P>I like to automate as much as possible.  Sometimes that means writing a program that generates another program or script.
<H4>Processing mail files</H4>


<P>I wanted to get a sequence of SQL commands that would update our database whenever someone's email bounced.  Processing the mail file is pretty easy since you can look for the error code followed by the email address.  A bounced email looks like:

<P>Notice the SMTP 550 error message.  Look for that at the start of a line then kill the angle brackets, remove the <TT>...</TT> and use <TT>awk</TT> to print out the SQL:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
# This script works on one email or a file full of other emails
# since it just looks for the SMTP 550 or 554 results and then
# converts them to SQL commands.
grep -E '^(550|554)' | \
        sed 's/[&lt;&gt;]//g' | \
        sed 's/\.\.\.//' | \
        awk "{printf(\"UPDATE PERSON SET bounce=1 WHERE email='%s';\n\",\$3);}" &gt;&gt; bounces.sql

<P>I have to escape the <TT>$3</TT> because it means something to the surround bash shell script and I want <TT>awk</TT> to see the dollar sign.
