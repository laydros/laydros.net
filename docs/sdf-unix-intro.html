<h1><a name="SECTION00200000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">1</span>. To Do</a>
</h1>

<p>
How to make a web site on SDF.  Probably mention the <tt>mkhomepg</tt> (or whatever it's called) command &amp; give pointers
to other articles about HTML &amp; CGI.

<p>
Mention Tweak membership on SDF.

<p>
Mention some games.

<p>
Better discussion of membership levels on SDF.  This is a
toughie to do because this is mostly an introduction to
unix, with only some SDF-specific goodies, not a full SDF
policy document.  Maybe it would be suitable to mention that
any unix system might allow only certain users to run
certain programs, &amp; I could give brief details of SDF's
membership levels.  This was requested or suggested by at
least two people on <em>bboard</em> / <small>GENERAL</small>, so it's
not a frivolous request.  Hmmm...

<p>
Discuss Zmodem (<em>rz</em>, <em>sz</em>).

<p>
Put it in gopher space.

<p>

<h1><a name="SECTION00300000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">2</span>. Introduction</a>
</h1>

<p>
This is for people who are new to unix, especially people
who are new to unix &amp; new to <a name="tex2html3" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110426193653/http://sdf.lonestar.org/">Super
Dimension Fortress</a>
(SDF), a
public access unix system.

<p>
I sometimes hang out in the chat rooms on SDF, &amp; almost
every day someone enters who has recently created an account
&amp; asks how to get started using unix &amp; the features of
SDF.  It's an awkward situation because there is a lot to
know to get started with unix; it would be difficult to
explain it all in a chat room.  What's more, most of the
regulars in those chat rooms have seen &amp; answered the
question enough times that they understandably do not look
forward to doing so again.

<p>
So I'm answering that question here, once.  If all goes
well, when someone enters a chat room &amp; asks how to start
learning about unix, someone can point them to this
article.

<p>

<h1><a name="SECTION00310000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">2</span>.<span class="arabic">1</span> What to read first</a>
</h1>

<p>
If you already know what unix is, or if you don't but you
also don't enjoy reading about petty controversies about a
definition, skip the ``What is Unix'' chapter &amp; start
reading Chapter&nbsp;<a href="#basics">4</a> ``Some Basic Commands''.

<p>

<h1><a name="SECTION00400000000000000000"></a>
<a name="unx-what-is-unix"></a><br>
<span class="arabic">3</span>. What is Unix?
</h1>

<p>
What is unix?  That's a loaded question.

<p>

<h1><a name="SECTION00410000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">3</span>.<span class="arabic">1</span> Short Answer</a>
</h1>

<p>
The short answer is ``Unix is an operating system''.  So is
Gnu/Linux, which is often just called Linux.  So are HP/UX,
AIX, NeXT STEP (now called Apple Macintosh OS 10), &amp;
Microthought Winders (often called many uncomplimentary
things).

<p>
If this short answer is enough for you, congratulations on
knowing the value of keeping things simple.  Now skip ahead
to Chapter&nbsp;<a href="#basics">4</a> ``Some Basic Commands''.

<p>

<h1><a name="SECTION00420000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">3</span>.<span class="arabic">2</span> Long Answer</a>
</h1>

<p>
The long answer is ``It depends on who you ask''.

<p>

<h2><a name="SECTION00421000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">3</span>.<span class="arabic">2</span>.<span class="arabic">1</span> My Opinion</a>
</h2>

<p>
In my opinion, unix is a description of the function of an
operating system.  I even say that unix is an Application
Programmer's Interface (API).  Any operating system which
implements the unix API is a unix; it's an implementation of
unix.  Gnu/Linux is a unix.<a name="tex2html4" href="footnode.html#foot254"><sup><span class="arabic">3</span>.<span
class="arabic">1</span></sup></a>  Gnu/Linux is often called
Linux, but strictly speaking, Linux is a unix kernel, but
not a whole unix operating system.  There are many other
implementations of unix.  I can name original BSD, OpenBSD,
FreeBSD, NetBSD, HP/UX, AIX, Minix, Apple Macintosh OS 10,
NeXT STEP, QNX, &amp; Lynx.  There are probably others.

<p>
Now for some legal bullshit.  ``UNIX'' is a trademark of
<a name="tex2html5" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110426193653/http://www.opengroup.org/">The Open
Group</a>.  From what I can infer
from their web site about their opinions of what unix is,
they would agree with me that it's a description of the
function of a family of operating systems, but they would
also add ``that we have certified to be UNIX''.  So legally,
it's not a UNIX unless The Open Group certifies it as a
UNIX.  So a lot of those operating systems I listed as
unices are not UNIXes.  It's a thoroughly sad case of
legalities getting in the way of simplicity &amp; sanity.

<p>
Anyway, I say that if an operating system behaves like unix,
then it's a unix, though not necessarily a UNIX<span class="MATH"><img width="31" height="19" align="BOTTOM" border="0"
src="/web/20110426193653im_/http://cybertiggyr.com/gene/unx/img1.png" alt="$^{(tm)}$"></span>.

<p>

<h2><a name="SECTION00422000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">3</span>.<span class="arabic">2</span>.<span class="arabic">2</span> Another Opinion</a>
</h2>

<p>
Another opinion, which I don't share, is that Unix is a
particular product.  HP/UX is another.  AIX is another.
Gnu/Linux is another.  You get the idea.

<p>
Fine, except that there is no product simply called
``Unix'' for sale today.  You can't even point at a product
that is the direct descendant of the original Unix that
Ritchie &amp; Thompson wrote at AT&amp;T.  Their Unix was <em>the</em> definitive Unix, the original, the one named Unix.  You
can't buy it today, methinks.  And many of those that you
can obtain today shared code with the original Unix.  BSD is
Unix as modified by students at the University of California
in Berkeley.  That's where sockets were invented.  BSD
branched into many implementations, several of which are
alive &amp; well today.  Theoretically, each of those
implementations has at least some of the original Unix code
in them.  Yet somehow BSD isn't a unix?  Get real.  I'm sure
there are similar examples of cross-pollination between the
other unix operating systems available today.

<p>
Another problem with the claim that BSD, Gnu/Linux, &amp; the
others are not unix is that it takes little effort to write
a program that runs on all of them.  There are enough
differences that a non-trivial program requires a little
care to be portable, but it's not like portability concerns
affect the architecture of your program.  All in all, it is
easy to port code between HP/UX, AIX, Gnu/Linux, &amp; the
BSDs.  This isn't an accident.  Those products are
implementations of a single idea of what an operating system
should be.  That idea needs a name so that when you ask me
what kind of operating system I program for a living, I
don't have to reply with ``I'm an HP/UX, Gnu/Linux, AIX,
FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, QNX, &amp; others programmer''.  I
say the name for that concept is ``unix''.  If not, then
it's POSIX, but POSIX is also a trademarked term with a
certification schedule from The Open Group (together with
IEEE).

<p>
So somewhat out of contempt for our legal system's petty
concerns for terminology, I say it's all ``unix''.  There
you have it, in more detail &amp; controversy than anyone with
a sense of perspective would ever want.

<p>

<h1><a name="SECTION00500000000000000000"></a>
<a name="basics"></a><br>
<span class="arabic">4</span>. Some Basic Commands
</h1>

<p>

<h1><a name="SECTION00510000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">4</span>.<span class="arabic">1</span> The Command Line Shell</a>
</h1>

<p>
When you login to a unix system, you'll be on a command
line.  It'll have a prompt like ``<tt>$</tt>'' or ``<tt>bash-2.04$ </tt>'' or maybe ``<tt>%</tt>''.  There are other
variations.

<p>
The command line is how you communicate with the <em>shell</em>.  The shell is a program that reads commands from a
command line &amp; runs other programs.  It does some other
things, but they are mostly details.  The main point of a
shell is to run programs.

<p>
The traditional, original shell on unix is called the Bourne
shell.  If you're wondering why it's called the Bourne
shell, ask yourself who might have written it.

<p>
The Bourne shell program is named <tt>/bin/sh</tt>, but that
program on most modern unices is actually a pointer to the
Korn shell or the Born Again shell.  Those two shells are
more modern than the Bourne shell, but they are backward
compatible with it.

<p>
There are other shells, including C shell (<tt>/bin/csh</tt>)
&amp; the restricted shell.  You can change your shell on many
unices with the <tt>chsh</tt> command.  Since a shell is just a program,
no magic behind it, you can use damned near any program you
want as your shell.  You could use Perl as your shell, I've
used clisp as a shell (just for an experiment), or you could
write your own shell.

<p>
The important thing about a shell is that most of the things
you type to it are interpreted as requests to run a
program.  If you type ``<tt>ls</tt>'', you're asking your shell
to run a program called <em>ls</em>.  If you type ``<tt>bogie
-k lap -f lap woo woo -d hickie</tt>'', you're asking it to run
a program called <em>bogie</em> with all that other crap as
<em>command line arguments</em>.

<p>
Enough about shells for now.

<p>

<h1><a name="SECTION00520000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">4</span>.<span class="arabic">2</span> Listing Files</a>
</h1>

<p>
On unix, the <em>ls</em> program gives you lists of files.

<p>
If you just type ``<tt>ls</tt>'', you'll get a list of the
files in the current directory.  Like this:

<p>
<pre>
bash-2.04$ ls
#unx.tex#  RCS  unx.aux  unx.bbl  unx.blg  unx.log  unx.tex  unx.tex~  unx.toc
bash-2.04$
</pre>

<p>
Notice that <em>ls</em>, when used in this plain way, doesn't
show you files sizes or permissions or anything like that.
Unix is traditionally tery terse.  Programs show you only
the information you requested, plus error messages.  You
don't have progress messages like ``2003-12-06T16:16
beginning to read files'' and ``2003-12-06T16:17 reading
first file'' and other nonsense cluttering your screen.  The
programs just print what's important.

<p>
If you want <em>ls</em> to print the details about the files,
give it the ``<tt>-l</tt>'' option.  That's a minus sign (<tt>-</tt>) followed by a letter <em>el</em> (<tt>l</tt>).  Like this:

<p>
<pre>
bash-2.04$ ls -l
total 52
-rw-r-----    1 gene     gene         9181 Dec  6 16:18 #unx.tex#
drwxrwx---    2 gene     gene         4096 Dec  6 14:03 RCS
-rw-rw----    1 gene     gene         1390 Dec  6 14:47 unx.aux
-rw-rw----    1 gene     gene           49 Dec  6 14:47 unx.bbl
-rw-rw----    1 gene     gene          878 Dec  6 14:47 unx.blg
-rw-rw----    1 gene     gene         4201 Dec  6 14:47 unx.log
-rw-r-----    1 gene     gene         6387 Dec  6 14:47 unx.tex
-rw-rw----    1 gene     gene         1212 Dec  6 13:49 unx.tex~
-rw-rw----    1 gene     gene          658 Dec  6 14:47 unx.toc
bash-2.04$
</pre>

<p>
The first column, which has all those minus signs, <em>r</em>s,
&amp; <em>w</em>s, shows the <a name="tex2html7"
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110426193653/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~rc/help/faq/permissions.html">file permissions</a>.  The next
column is
the number of links to the file.<a name="tex2html6" href="footnode.html#foot292"><sup><span class="arabic">4</span>.<span
class="arabic">1</span></sup></a>  The next column is the
user who owns the file.  The next is the group of the file.
Then there's the number of bytes in the file.  Then the date
the file was modified.  Then the file's name.

<p>
Here's an exercise: Type ``<tt>echo *</tt>'' on the command
line, like this:

<p>
<pre>
bash-2.04$ echo *
#unx.tex# RCS unx.aux unx.bbl unx.blg unx.log unx.tex unx.tex~ unx.toc
bash-2.04$
</pre>

<p>
Now go figure out why or how <em>echo</em> differs from <em>ls</em>.

<p>

<h1><a name="SECTION00530000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">4</span>.<span class="arabic">3</span> Moving Around the File System</a>
</h1>

<p>
All unix systems have a file system whose root directory is
<tt>/</tt>.  Your home directory is somewhere inside a
directory in the file system.  Maybe your home directory is
<tt>/home/you</tt> or <tt>/usr/hm0/you</tt> or whatever.  The
details depend on the unix.  To learn your home directory,
type ``<tt>echo $HOME</tt>'', like this:

<p>
<pre>
bash-2.04$ echo $HOME
/home/gene
bash-2.04$
</pre>

<p>
Unix has a notion of a <em>current working directory</em>.  To
see what your current working directory is, type ``<tt>pwd</tt>'', like this:

<p>
<pre>
bash-2.04$ pwd
/home/gene/library/website/docsrc/unx
bash-2.04$
</pre>

<p>
To change your current working directory, use the <em>cd</em>
command.  Give it the name of the new directory you want.
If you want to move to the current working directory's
parent, use ``<tt>..</tt>''.  Here are some examples:

<p>
<pre>
bash-2.04$ pwd
/home/gene/library/website/docsrc/unx
bash-2.04$ cd ..  # move to parent
bash-2.04$ pwd
/home/gene/library/website/docsrc
bash-2.04$ cd .. # move to parent again
bash-2.04$ pwd
/home/gene/library/website
bash-2.04$ cd share # move into the "share" directory
bash-2.04$ pwd
/home/gene/library/website/share
bash-2.04$ cd /tmp  # move to this absolute directory
bash-2.04$ pwd
/tmp
bash-2.04$

The <em>vi</em> commands might not make much sense at first,
but notice that you can use all of them with the fingers
from the right hand.  They may not be the most mnemonic
commands, but they are very functional.

<p>
Some programs besides <em>vi</em> which use the <em>vi</em>
cursor-movement commands include:

<p>

<ul>
<li>the mail reader called <a href="#mutt">mutt</a>, but just
the <em>j</em> &amp; <em>k</em> keys in its menus
</li>
<li><tt>/usr/games/worm</tt>, an old game &amp; an excellent way

<span class="arabic">4</span>.<span class="arabic">5</span> E-mail</a>
</h1>

<p>
Most unix systems give you multiple options for how to read
your e-mail.

<p>
If you want to read your e-mail with a text-only program you
run from the command line (which is how I read e-mail), some
common programs are <em>mutt</em> and <em>pine</em>.  Just type
the name of either of those programs.  If you see a list of
e-mail, it means the program is available, &amp; you are
running it.  If you see an error message that says ``command
not found'', it means your shell couldn't find it, maybe
because it's not available on your unix.

<p>
You can figure out the basics of <em>mutt</em> or <em>pine</em>
just by using them.  People become almost religiously
devoted to their favorite e-mail programs, so you can learn
more detailed or subtle ways of using a mail program by
asking someone who prefers that program.  People are usually
happy to tell you more than you want to know about how to
use their favorite e-mail program.  So pick one of them,
figure out the basics on your own, &amp; then go find a
long-time user of that program &amp; strike up a conversation
about it with him.

<p>
I've never used <em>pine</em>, so I can't tell you how.  I
sometimes use <em>mutt</em>, so here is some super-quick info
on using <em>mutt</em>.

<p>

<h2><a name="SECTION00551000000000000000"></a>
<a name="mutt"></a><br>
<span class="arabic">4</span>.<span class="arabic">5</span>.<span class="arabic">1</span> mutt
</h2>

<p>
The official documentation about <em>mutt</em> is at
<a name="tex2html9" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110426193653/http://www.mutt.org/">http://www.mutt.org/</a>.

<p>
When you run <em>mutt</em>, you'll see a list of e-mail
messages.  Each line on your screen will show a subject, a
date, &amp; who sent the message.

<p>
One of the messages will be selected.  To view the selected
message, type the Return, Enter, or Space-bar key (I can't
remember which).  You'll see the body of the message.

<p>
When you are viewing the body of a message, type the Space
bar to page down.  When you come to the end of the message,
type the Space bar to view the next unread message.  If
there are no more unread messages, you'll see the list of
messages again.

<p>
When you are viewing the body of a message, you can type
``<tt>q</tt>'' to quit that view &amp; return to the list of
messages.

<p>
In the list of messages, the ``<tt>j</tt>'' key moves the
cursor down &amp; selects that message.  The ``<tt>k</tt>'' key
moves the cursor up &amp; selects that message.  The ``<tt>q</tt>'' key exits <em>mutt</em>.

<span class="arabic">4</span>.<span class="arabic">5</span>.<span class="arabic">2</span> Graphical E-mail Readers</a>
</h2>

<p>
If you want to read your e-mail with a graphical e-mail
reader, maybe the one in your web browser, you'll need a
more elaborate setup.  You'll need to instruct your mail
client to use your unix account for sending &amp; receiving
messages.  It sends messages via the Simple Mail Transport
Protocol (SMTP).  It downloads messages that you receive via
the Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3).  Of course, the
unix system where you have your account must be configured
to allow these operations.  You'll need to refer to the
documentation for that computer system to do all this, but
it can be done if the unix system allows it.

<p>
For the record, I usually use the <em>rmail</em> mode in Gnu

<h1><a name="SECTION00560000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">4</span>.<span class="arabic">6</span> Viewing Files</a>
</h1>

<p>
If you have a file you want to read, use the <em>less</em>
program to read it.  For example, if the file is called <tt>README</tt> &amp; is in your current directory, type ``<tt>less
README</tt>''.  If that gets you a ``command not found'' error,
try ``<tt>more README</tt>''.

<p>
You'll see the first part of the file on your screen.  (If
it's a really short file, you'll see all of it on your
screen.)  To see the next screen-full, type the Space bar.
To see the previous screen-full, type the ``<tt>b</tt>'' key.
To quit viewing the file &amp; return to the command line, type
the ``<tt>q</tt>'' key.

<p>

<h1><a name="SECTION00570000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">4</span>.<span class="arabic">7</span> Surf the Web</a>
</h1>

<p>
A good web browser to use on a text-only command line is
<em>lynx</em>.  You can give it an URL to read on the command
line, like this: ``<tt>lynx http://lisp-p.org/</tt>'' or ``<tt>lynx http://google.com/</tt>''.  Use the Space bar to page down,
the ``<tt>b</tt>'' key to page up, the arrow keys to select
hyperlinks, &amp; the Return or Enter key to follow a
hyperlink.  Use the ``<tt>q</tt>'' key to quit.

<p>
Unless the unix system where you have an account is very
trusting, you probably cannot run a graphical web browser on
it.  Technically it can be done using the graphical system
called X (which is common on unices), setting permissions
with the <em>xhost</em> program, &amp; setting your DISPLAY
environment variable, but it usually is not allowed on a
public access unix.

<a name="ftp"></a><br>
<span class="arabic">4</span>.<span class="arabic">8</span>.<span class="arabic">1</span> FTP
</h2>

<p>
To transfer files between your home computer &amp; a remote
unix, use the program called <em>ftp</em>.  Your home computer
almost certainly has a copy, even if you run Microthought
Winders at home.

<p>
To run <em>ftp</em>, first go to a command line.  Then type
``<tt>ftp ftp.freeshell.org</tt>'' to connect to the FTP server
at SDF.

<p>
The <em>ftp</em> client has a command line interface.  Here are
some of the commands it understands:

<p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>cd <em>directory</em></strong></dt>
<dd>Change directory on the remote
    FTP server.
</dd>
<dt><strong>dir</strong></dt>
<dd>Print a lsit of the files in the current
    directory on the remote FTP server.
</dd>
<dt><strong>ascii</strong></dt>
<dd>Tell FTP to assume that files you transfer
    are text files.
</dd>
<dt><strong>binary</strong></dt>
<dd>Tell FTP to assume that files you trnasfer
    are binary files.
</dd>
<dt><strong>hash</strong></dt>
<dd>Tell FTP to print an octothorpe character (#)
    for each block it sends or receives.  It helps you see
    the progress of the file transfer.
</dd>
<dt><strong>put <em>filename</em></strong></dt>
<dd>Upload a file.
</dd>
<dt><strong>get <em>filename</em></strong></dt>
<dd>Download a file.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In general, use the <em>cd</em> command to enter the correct
directory on the remote FTP server.  Then set the correct
mode (<em>ascii</em> or <em>binary</em>).  Then use <em>get</em> to
download a file or <em>put</em> to upload one.

<p>
The <em>ftp</em> client program supports many more commands.
Use ``<tt>man ftp</tt>'' for more information about FTP.

<p>
In case you are interested: FTP refers to the File Transfer
Protocol; it was one of the three requirements that created
the Arpa Net which became the Internet.  <em>Ftp</em> is also
the name of the File Transfer Program which implements FTP.

<h2><a name="SECTION00582000000000000000"></a>
<a name="scp"></a><br>
<span class="arabic">4</span>.<span class="arabic">8</span>.<span class="arabic">2</span> scp
</h2>

<p>
<em>scp</em> is the Secure Shell Copy Program.  It's name is
also a reference to <em>rcp</em>, the Remote Copy Program.

<p>
Use <em>scp</em> like you would use <em>cp</em>, but it can copy
from one computer to another.

<p>
For example, if I want to copy <tt>myfile.cpio.bz2</tt> on my
computer into the <tt>tmp</tt> directory in my account on SDF,
I would run this: ``<tt>scp myfile.cpio.bz2
gms@freeshell.org:tmp/</tt>''.  The <em>scp</em> program will
probably prompt me for my password, then it will copy the
file.

<p>
Run ``<tt>man scp</tt>'' to get more information about using
<em>scp</em>.

<p>
In my experience, <em>scp</em> takes longer than <em>ftp</em> to
transfer files, &amp; it gives up easily.  If either computer
or the network is slow, <em>scp</em> gives up quickly.  So I
prefer <em>ftp</em>.

<p>
Ed&nbsp;Chang has told me that there is an implementation of <em>scp</em> for Microthought Winders called WinSCP, at
<a name="tex2html10"
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110426193653/http://winscp.sourceforge.net/eng/about.php">http://winscp.sourceforge.net/eng/about.php</a>.
I haven't tried it myself, but it sounds like it might be
pretty good.

<span class="arabic">4</span>.<span class="arabic">8</span>.<span class="arabic">3</span> rcp
</h2>

<p>
You can't use <em>rcp</em> on SDF, so this section applies when
copying files between other unix systems.

<p>
An old but pretty cool program for copying files between two
unices is <em>rcp</em>, the Remote Copy Program.

<p>
For <em>rcp</em> to work, you must first configure the <tt>.rhosts</tt> files in your accounts on the unix systems.  Then
you can copy files from one system to another with the <em>rcp</em> program.

<p>
For example, if I want to copy <tt>myfile.cpio.bz2</tt> on the
local
computer into the <tt>tmp</tt> directory in my account on a
computer called <tt>overthere</tt>,
I would run this: ``<tt>rcp myfile.cpio.bz2
overthere:tmp/</tt>''.  The <em>rcp</em> program will
copy the file; it won't ask me for my password.

<span class="arabic">4</span>.<span class="arabic">8</span>.<span class="arabic">4</span> When FTP Doesn't Work</a>
</h2>

<p>
If you don't have FTP on your home computer, you can
transfer files via e-mail.

<p>
First, make sure you have an e-mail account that allows you
to send files as attachments.  You might use the e-mail
account that your ISP supplied with your Internet
connection, or you might create a Web e-mail account on
Yahoo!, Hotmail, or any of the many other systems that
provide free Web e-mail accounts.

<p>
To transfer a file from your home computer to SDF, you
create an e-mail message on your e-mail account that is <em>not</em> on SDF.  Attach the file; with a Web e-mail account,
it'll allow you to upload the file into the e-ail message.
Then send the message.
Give it a minute to arrive, then login to your account on
SDF.  Receive the message with an e-mail program which knows
how to deal with attached files.  Mutt &amp; pine both know
about attachments.  Use that e-mail program to save the
attachment to a file.

<p>
To transfer a file from SDF to your home computer through
e-mail, login to SDF &amp; send the file to your non-SDF
account as an attachment to an e-mail message.  Then receive
the message on your non-SDF e-mail account &amp; save the file
to your home computer's file system.

<span class="arabic">4</span>.<span class="arabic">9</span> Editing Files
</h1>

<p>
There are two great religions in the modern world: <em>emacs</em> and <em>vi</em>.

<p>
The two most popular file editors on unix are <em>emacs</em>
and <em>vi</em>.

<p>
<em>Emacs</em> is more properly called Gnu Emacs because emacs
is a way of programming file editors, &amp; Gnu Emacs is just
one editor written in that way.  I believe Gnu Emacs was the
first big production product of Gnu.  Richard&nbsp;Stallman wrote
it himself.  It is a Lisp with screen-handling functions
built-in.  It's a great big powerful editor, an operating
environment, &amp; I love it.  To try emacs, type ``<tt>emacs</tt>'', wait for the screen to update, then type the
Escape key, the <tt>x</tt> key, then ``<tt>info</tt>'', then press
Return.  Carefully read &amp; follow the instructions you see
on the screen.  It's kind of difficult to learn emacs from
the start, but once you do, it's great.

<p>
The other popular editor on unix is <em>vi</em>.  I don't use
vi much.  Two web sites that discuss it are

<h1><a name="SECTION00610000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">5</span>.<span class="arabic">1</span> The Man</a>
</h1>

<p>
Most of a unix system is documented in the online manual,
called the <em>man</em>.  If you want to know about a program,
you look it up in the <em>man</em>.  For example, if you want
to learn more about the <em>ls</em> program, type ``<tt>man
ls</tt>''.

<p>
The man also has a simple search capability.  The ``<tt>-k</tt>'' command line option tells the man to give you a list
of entries that mention a particular keyword, which you also
supply on the command line.  If you want to
get a list of the manual entries that menion networking, you
would type ``<tt>man -k network</tt>''.

<p>
The man is divided into sections.  If you don't specify a
section when you ask the man to lookup documentation for a
program, the man takes a guess about what section you mean,
&amp; it usually assumes you mean the most general, high-level
section available (section 1).  You can specify a section as
the second argument to <em>man</em>, before the keyword.  For
example, if I want to read about the <tt>select</tt> function
in section 2 (the kernel API), I would type ``<tt>man 2
select</tt>''.

<p>
Here are some things I recommend reading in the man to get
started with unix.  I give you the exact command to type,
then an explanation of why I recommend that entry in the man.

<p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>man man</strong></dt>
<dd>This tells you how to use the online manual.
</dd>
<dt><strong>man 1 intro</strong></dt>
<dd>This tells you about the general section
    of the online manual.  You should also try ``<tt>man 2
    intro</tt>'' &amp; all the other intros for sections 3 through
    9.
</dd>
<dt><strong>man mutt</strong></dt>
<dd>Tells you how to use <em>mutt</em>, the e-mail
    reader.
</dd>
<dt><strong>man pine</strong></dt>
<dd>Tells you how to use <em>pine</em>, the e-mail

</dd>
<dt><strong>man sh</strong></dt>
<dd>Tells you how to use &amp; program the shell.
</dd>
<dt><strong>man 4 tcp</strong></dt>
<dd>Tells you how to program TCP sockets.  I

<p>
I tell newbies about the man all the time, but they usually don't
try it.

<p>
I don't know why they don't believe me.  I started
using unix in college in 1985.  In a class, the professor
gave everyone an account &amp; told us to login after class &amp;
type ``<tt>man man</tt>''.  He didn't tell us anything else,
not even what ``man man'' would do.  By exploring the manual
on my own time for a couple of evenings, plus a couple of
conversations with the unix gurus that worked in the lab, I
was pretty good with unix.  It was an excellent way to start
using &amp; programming unix.

<p>
Maybe the newbies do believe me, but they're lazy.

<h1><a name="SECTION00620000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">5</span>.<span class="arabic">2</span> Gnu info</a>
</h1>

<p>
Besides the unix <em>man</em>, Gnu/Linux computers usually have
some information in a hypertext system call <em>info</em>.

<p>
To use <em>info</em> from the command line, just type ``<tt>info</tt>''.  If you are a Gnu Emacs user, you can run emacs &amp;
type Meta-x <tt>info</tt>, &amp; you'll be presented with the same
data in the same format that <em>info</em> would.

<p>
<em>Info</em> is an interactive hypertext system.  It predates
the Web by at least five years, methinks.  Read &amp; follow
the instructions on the screen &amp; you'll be alright.

<p>
<em>Info</em> systems are not always maintained as well as the
man, but most are pretty good, &amp; some have a lot of
excellent information.  It is often well-written, too.  It's
an enjoyable read, &amp; since you can page through the entire
system one screen-full at a time by typing the Space bar,
it's convenient to read.

<p>
Though it's not for beginning users, I'll mention here that
one of my favorite sections in <em>info</em> is the
documentation for Autoconf.

<h1><a name="SECTION00630000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">5</span>.<span class="arabic">3</span> Books</a>
</h1>

<p>
I can't recommend any books on using unix.  I learned it so
long ago that I don't remember what books I used, or even if
I used any books.  Here are some interesting books about
unix, though not exactly about <em>using</em> unix.

<p>
I like Mike&nbsp;Gancarz's book, <em>The Unix Philosophy</em>, a
lot.  It talks about the reasons behind writing applications
the unix way: with small programs piped together, &amp; with
flat, plain text data files.  I have heard that
Eric&nbsp;Raymond's book, <em>The Art of UNIX Programming</em>,
is similar &amp; also good, but I haven't read it
myself.<a name="tex2html13" href="footnode.html#foot480"><sup><span class="arabic">5</span>.<span class="arabic">1</span></sup></a>
<p>
Even though we're talking about using unix, I think an
understanding of how operating systems work is useful to
know, &amp; Andrew&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Tanenbaum's <em>Modern Operating
Systems</em> is an excellent book.  It includes a good
section about unix.  He points out that the defining
characteristic about early unix was its 40 system
calls.  We've added more system calls, but the unix kernel
still has a fairly small number of elegant, well-chosen
system calls.  That's an important part of what makes unix
what it is.

<h1><a name="SECTION00640000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">5</span>.<span class="arabic">4</span> Folklore</a>
</h1>

<p>
One of the cool things about unix is that it has  played an
intimate part in the folklore of computing since the late
1970s.  There are all sorts of interesting tales &amp;
personalities to explain or help you remember why something
was done a particular way.  The history is not hidden inside
a corporation.  It's out in the open, &amp; lots of people know it.

<p>
That's also one of the bad things about unix because it
means you need to talk to people to learn what you need to
learn next.  Hopefully people will write downt he folklore
&amp; also link to it so that new unix users &amp; programmers can
find it.

<p>
You can learn the folklore by talking (or typing) to an
experienced unix user or programmer.  A good place to read
about it online is <a name="tex2html14" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110426193653/http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/">The Jargon

<span class="arabic">6</span>.<span class="arabic">1</span> Getting Information on SDF</a>
</h1>

<p>
Use the <em>faq</em> or <em>help</em> commands to get information
about SDF.  These are not standard unix programs.  They are
specific to SDF.

<p>
The <em>help</em> command mostly gives you lists of other
commands.  If you type ``<tt>help</tt>'', you'll see a menu
like this:

<p>
<pre>
SDF Help System - v8, 1993 - sdf!smj

 [a] Directory and File Utilities
 [b] Email Information
 [c] USENET Information
 [d] User and Process Information
 [e] Tutorials and Very Useful Commands
 [f] ARPA Services (internetworking)

 [q] Quit SDF Help System

Your Choice?
For more help, type 'faq'
For a list of basic UNIX commands, type 'unix'
to remove your account, type 'delme'
</pre>

<p>
Most of the letters in the menu will give you lists of
commands.  After you quit the <em>help</em> program with
``<tt>q</tt>'', you could run the commands or read more about
them in the online manual I discussed earlier.
Some of the programs are specific to SDF &amp; are not
discussed in the man.  SDF's excellent <em>com</em> program is
an example of a program that is not discussed in the man.

<p>
To me, the <em>faq</em> program is more useful.  In it, you can
find short explanations of unix file permissions, uploading
&amp; downloading, SDF's policies, &amp; the history of SDF.

<p>
To enter the faq, type ``<tt>faq</tt>'' on the command line, &amp; the <em>faq</em> program gives
you a list of sections.  This is faq's main menu.  You can
exit by typing ``<tt>q</tt>'' here.  If you type ``<tt>g</tt>'', it will
ask you for the name of a section.  You enter  a section
name &amp; press return, &amp; you'll see the section's menu.

<p>
In a section's menu, you have a numbered list of questions
or topics.  If you type ``<tt>g</tt>'', &amp; press return, you'll see
main menu again.  If you type ``<tt>t</tt>'', you'll be prompted for
the number of a question or topic.  Type that &amp; press
return.  You should type the number exactly as it appears in
the menu, including leading zeros.

<p>
Some things you can learn from the <em>faq</em> include:

<p>

<ul>
<li>SDF's policies (&amp; prices, methinks)
</li>
<li>brief history of unix
</li>
</ul>

<p>
SDF has its own chat system, called <tt>com</tt>.  It's like a
stripped-down IRC, but much cooler than IRC because people
actually talk, &amp; you don't get unwanted pop-up download
files &amp; you don't have tons &amp; tons of bots waiting to
download ``warez''.  Anyway, <tt>com</tt> is like IRC except
that <tt>com</tt> is cool.

<p>
To use com, type ``<tt>com</tt>'' on the command line.  You'll
be plopped into the lobby, which is the default room.

<p>
Com uses <em>single-key commands</em> mostly.  If you are new to <tt>com</tt>, you might want to read <a href="#com-command-discussion">COM
Command
Discussion</a> in this same
article.  If you are having trouble exiting from the <tt>com</tt> program, then you definitely need to read <a
href="#com-command-discussion">COM Command
Discussion</a>.

<p>
Table&nbsp;<a href="#tab-com-commands">6.1</a> shows the most frequently
needed <tt>com</tt> commands.

Also, from COM Mode, you can compete with others in games of
Nethack, Netris, &amp; some others.  If you can master the ``h'' command in COM,
it will show you the commands for playing these games.

<p>
The <tt>com</tt> commands are <em>hot</em>.  By that, I mean that
you type a command character, &amp; <tt>com</tt> immediately takes
action.  You must be careful to type only the command
character you intend.  If you type other characters along
with the character you intend, one of those other characters
might be interpreted as a command, &amp; the character you
intend will be interpreted as an argument to that command.
It might sound like I'm being pedantic, but people who are
new to <tt>com</tt> often have this problem.

<p>
Table&nbsp;<a href="#tab-proper-com">6.2</a> shows the proper sequence of
steps for entering a command in <tt>com</tt>.  It assumes you
are already running <tt>com</tt> &amp; that you are not currently
processing any <tt>com</tt> commands.  You are just reading the
text in the room.

<p>
Step number 4 in Table&nbsp;<a href="#tab-proper-com">6.2</a> is critically
important &amp; deserves further discussion.
In step number 4, you touch (or ``type'') the command key.
You do not touch (or type) any other keys on your keyboard
or on any other keyboard.  You don't need to ``enter'' the
command by typing the Return or Enter key on your keyboard;
<tt>com</tt> will acknowledge your command key
immediately.<a name="tex2html18" href="footnode.html#foot691"><sup><span class="arabic">6</span>.<span class="arabic">1</span></sup></a>
<p>
A common error for new users is to type the Return (or
Enter) key after they type the command key.  <tt>Com</tt>
executes the command key fine, then it notices the Return
key.  Return is a command, so <tt>com</tt> executes it.  The
Return command gets you a prompt so that you may enter text
that you ``say'' for other people to ``hear'' in the room.
Because of the Return key, <tt>com</tt> is not interpreting the
new user's keystrokes as commands.

<p>
Then the new user tries to type another command, such as the
``q'' (quit) command, but <tt>com</tt> interprets it as text to
say into the room.  The new user is under the impression
that he needs to end commands with Return, so he does that,
which causes <tt>com</tt> to print ``q'' into the room for
everyone to see.  The new user is confused about why his
command doesn't execute, so he types ``h'' &amp; Return again.
The ``h'' is interpreted as a command &amp; gets him a menu,
but the Return is also interpreted as a command &amp; puts him
into enter-a-line-of-text mode.  He sees the ``q'' command
in the menu, types it &amp; Return, &amp; the cycle repeats.

<p>
All of this discussion may seem silly to most people, but a
lot of new users have amazingly huge amounts of trouble when
they learn to enter a command into <tt>com</tt>.<a name="tex2html19" href="footnode.html#foot692"><sup><span class="arabic">6</span>.<span

<h2><a name="SECTION00722000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">6</span>.<span class="arabic">2</span>.<span class="arabic">2</span> COM Session Example</a>
</h2>

<p>
Let's walk a new user named <em>newbie</em> through his first
session in <tt>com</tt>.

<p>

<ol>
<li>Newbie starts on the unix command line.

<p>
</li>
<li>Newbie enters COM Mode by typing ``<tt>com</tt>'' &amp;
pressing the Return key.

<p>
</li>
<li>Newbie might have to wait a few seconds, but she
eventually sees <tt>com</tt> start.  (I think new users see a
menu of the <tt>com</tt> commands &amp; have to answer Yes that
they have read &amp; understood the menu.)  After <tt>com</tt>
starts, Newbie will be in the <em>lobby</em> &amp; will see a list
of the people in that room.  (The lobby is the default room
&amp; is where most of the chatting happens.)

<p>
</li>
<li>Newbie wants to say hello to everyone, so she types
the Space Bar &amp; waits until she sees a ``<tt>[newbie]</tt>''
prompt.  Then Newbie types ``Hi all.  I'm new.'' &amp; then
types the Return key.

<p>
</li>
<li>Everyone in the room will see ``<tt>[newbie] Hi all.
I'm new.</tt>''.

<p>
</li>
<li><em>Newbie is doing well so far, but now let's have
her make a mistake.</em>

<p>
</li>
<li>Newbie wants to leave <tt>com</tt>, but she can't
remember the command, so she types ``h'' to get a menu &amp;
pressed Return.  <em>This was a mistake.  Newbie should
have typed ``h'' alone &amp; not pressed Return.</em>

<p>
</li>
<li><em><tt>Com</tt> sees Newbie's ``h'' command &amp; prints the
help menu.  That's good, but <tt>com</tt> also sees Newbies
Return &amp; assumes Newbie wants to ``say'' a line of text
into the room.  So <tt>com</tt> prints a ``<tt>[newbie]</tt>''
prompt &amp; waits for Newbie to type some text, but Newbie is
busy reading the help menu &amp; doesn't notice the prompt.</em>

<p>
</li>
<li>Newbie sees the ``q'' (quit) command on the help menu
&amp; types ``q'' &amp; then Return.  <em>This is a double
mistake.  <tt>Com</tt> thinks Newbie is typing a line of text
to say into the room, so her ``q'' is not interpreted as a
command.  Also, Newbie is still under the incorrect belief
that she must end <tt>com</tt> commands with a Return.</em>

<p>
</li>
<li>Because of Newbie's mistake in the previous step, <tt>com</tt> prints ``<tt>[newbie] q</tt>'' into the room.

<p>
</li>
<li>Newbie is confused that her ``q'' command didn't work,
so she types ``h'' &amp; Return.  This takes her back to step
7.

<p>
She'll repeat this who knows how many times.  Other
  people in the lobby will notice her problem &amp; try to help,
  but Newbie has to go through the error many times before she
  stops typing Return after her commands.

<p>
The problem is compounded by <tt>com</tt>'s modality &amp;
  Newbie's failure to realize that <tt>com</tt> is modal.
  Sometimes, <tt>com</tt> is waiting for Newbie to type a
  command.  Some commands are single key.  (The ``q'' &amp;
  ``h'' commands are examples.)  Other commands wait for
  Newbie to type something, &amp; during that time, <tt>com</tt>
  does not interpret her keystrokes as commands.  (The Space
  Bar and Return commands, both of which are for saying text
  into the room, are examples.)

<p>
The other people in the room see what Newbie is going
  through, but there isn't much they can do because they
  can't see Newbie's screen &amp; help her figure out whether
  <tt>com</tt> is waiting for her to type a command or waiting
  for her to type text.  What's more, whenever they say
  something like ``Type <em>h</em> by itself'', Newbie types an
  ``h'' &amp; then a Return.  So Newbie keeps going around &amp;
  around.

<p>
</li>
<li>Eventually, Newbie figures it out while <tt>com</tt> is
waiting for her to type a command.  At this time, Newbie
types ``q'' (&amp; does not type any other characters at all).

<p>
</li>
<li>Newbie might have to wait a few seconds, but she
eventually sees <tt>com</tt> print an ``Unlinking tty''
message, &amp; then Newbie is dropped back into her unix
command line.
</li>
</ol>

<span class="arabic">6</span>.<span class="arabic">2</span>.<span class="arabic">3</span> What to Do if You Are Caught in the Newbie Loop</a>
</h2>

<p>
The problem is that <tt>com</tt> is modal &amp;
new users sometimes fail to realize that.

<p>
What does it mean for a program to be <b>modal</b>?
It means that sometimes, <tt>com</tt> is waiting for you to type a
command, &amp; sometimes it is waiting for you to type
arguments to a command.  Some commands are single key.  (The ``q'' &amp;
``h'' commands are examples.)  Other commands wait for
you to type something, &amp; during that time, <tt>com</tt>
does not interpret her keystrokes as commands.  (The Space
Bar and Return commands, both of which are for saying text
into the room, are examples.)

<p>
If you find yourself in the <tt>Com</tt> Newbie loop, here's
how to get out of it.  Follow the exact steps from
Table&nbsp;<a href="#tab-exit-newbie-loop">6.3</a>.  Type only what it says to
type.  Do not type anything else.  Do not type Return unless
a step in the table says to type Return.

</div><p></p><br>

<p>
Here's why the steps in Table&nbsp;<a href="#tab-exit-newbie-loop">6.3</a> work:

<p>

<ol>
<li>If <tt>com</tt> is waiting for you to type a command,
  then you could type the command anyway, but you type Space,
  which gets you a prompt (<tt>com</tt> isn't interpreting
  commands).  Then you type Return, which ends that prompt.
  So now  <tt>com</tt> is waiting for a command again.  So the
  Space Bar &amp; Return sequence was unnecessary, but it
  did not harm.  (People in the room won't even see it
  because if you try to ``say'' an empty line, <tt>com</tt>
  doesn't print anything.)
</li>
<li>If <tt>com</tt> has prompted you &amp; is not interpreting
  your commands, the Space Bar won't do anything useful, but
  the Return key will end that prompt.  If you had
mistakenly typed Return earlier &amp; <tt>com</tt> was waiting for
you to say something into the room, the Space Bar will do
nothing, but the Return will end that mode, &amp; <tt>com</tt>
will now wait for you to type a command..  (If you had
typed things before the Space Bar, you will ``say'' them
into the room.)
</li>

<h1><a name="SECTION00800000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">7</span>. Programming</a>
</h1>

<p>
So you want to learn to program?  Good.  Programming is fun,
creative, &amp; fascinating.  (It used to be a well-paying career, too.  I
guess it still is, if you are in India or China.)

<p>

<h1><a name="SECTION00810000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">7</span>.<span class="arabic">1</span> Language</a>
</h1>

<p>
There are billions &amp; billions of programming languages.
Well, not that many, but there's a damned lot.

<p>
You'll probably want to learn one of the most popular ones,
which is too bad because most of the currently popular
languages aren't very good.  They are complex versions of
the exact same features that have been available in
programming languages since the 1960s.  That's right: Even
after forty years of hyped, new languages, we've effectively
come full-circle to Algol 1960.

<p>
But I'm a bitter &amp; opinionated old programmer, so ignore
what I just wrote.  Here's some actually useful information:

<p>
You can use just about any language you want on unix.  At
the moment, it might be difficult to find a fully
functioning C# compiler for unix, but one is coming, &amp;
there is no technical reason that C# won't work on unix.
Many other programming languages are available for unix.
Heck, many were developed <em>on</em> unix.  So you can pick
pretty much whichever you want.

<p>
No matter what you pick, I highly recommend that you also do
some plain, vanilla C.  That's because the programming
language of unix is C.  When you need to write some programs
to experiment with some feature of unix to learn the details
of how it works before you use it in a larger program you
are writing, the best language for writing those
experimental programs is C because it hides the least from
you.  It's not that C is better, &amp; I'm not saying it's
better for writing applications.  I mean that because unix's
API is for C, C is the best language for discovering how
unix's system calls work.  C doesn't hide anything from
you.

<p>
There are two books you need to do serious C programming.

<p>
The first is the original &amp; the classic <em>The C
Programming Language</em>, by Kernighan &amp; Ritchie
([<a href="unx.html#kandr">aDMR88</a>]).  Yeah, it's old &amp; small, but since when is
information bad just because it's old?  And since when would
you rather take days to read a humongous tome that contained
no more information than in a small book like K&amp;R?

<p>
The second book you need for C programming is <em>The
Standard C Library</em>, by P. J. Plauger
([<a href="unx.html#plauger:library">Pla92</a>]).

<p>

<h1><a name="SECTION00820000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">7</span>.<span class="arabic">2</span> Languages on SDF</a>
</h1>

<p>
Here are some languages that are available on SDF.  You may
have to be validated or even ARPA to use some of them, but I
don't know for sure.

<p>
To learn a language, I recommend studying at least one book,
not just online sources.

<p>

<h1><a name="SECTION00830000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">7</span>.<span class="arabic">3</span> Theory</a>
</h1>

<p>
Obtain, read, &amp; understand a book about data structures.
Learn it &amp; learn to love it.  Data structures separates the
scripters from the programmers.

<p>

<h1><a name="SECTION00900000000000000000">
<span class="arabic">8</span>. Hacking</a>
</h1>

<p>
So you want to hack?  To break into computers?  Take them
over?  Get root access?  Crash them or use their CPU cycles
to do work for you?

<p>
Aim high, but I have some advice.  Those activities aren't
<a name="tex2html22" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110426193653/http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/H/hack.html">hacking</a>.
Those activities are part of
<a name="tex2html23" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110426193653/http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/C/cracking.html">cracking</a>.
For more information about the meaning of <em>hack</em>, you
might read two other chapters from The Jargon File:

<ul>
<li><a name="tex2html24" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110426193653/http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/meaning-of-hack.html">The Meaning
of
'Hack'</a> and
</li>
<li><a name="tex2html25" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110426193653/http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/crackers.html">Crackers, Phreaks,
&amp;
Lamers</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You might find some people in COM Mode who would like to
talk about these things, but most of them are really tired
of kiddies coming into the lobby &amp; asking ``Do any of you
know how to hack?''  So you'll need to be more subtle.  It's
like real life; you don't walk into a room, interrupt the
current conversation, &amp; loudly ask if anyone will sell you
nose candy.  It's just rude.

<p>
Information about security holes is pretty easy to
find without help.  Just use Google to search for things
like ``computer security virus hole exploit''.
What you need is the knowledge to make use
of that information.  You need to learn
straightforward programming techniques, especially
networking<a name="tex2html21" href="footnode.html#foot696"><sup><span class="arabic">8</span>.<span class="arabic">1</span></sup></a>,
before you can make use of all that security
information that is readily available.  So instead of
asking people to teach you to crack, it might be more
worthwhile &amp; fun to talk programming with people.

<p>
While we're on the topic, I guess I can throw out a bone.
Take a look at ``CIFS: Common Insecurities Fail Scrutiny''
([<a href="unx.html#hobbit:cifs">Hob77</a>]).

<p>
Also, be aware that most of the
protocols in use on the Internet are defined in the Request
For Comment (RFC) documents.  One database of RFCs is
<a name="tex2html26" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110426193653/http://www.rfc-editor.org/">The RFC
Editor</a>.  Another such database
is <a name="tex2html27" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110426193653/http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/cs/Services/rfc/index.html">RFCs at
Ohio State University</a>.

<p>
Why do you care about the RFCs?  Because to find a hole in
some protocol, you need to know the actual protocol, not
just heresay that people slip to you in a chat room.  To
know the protocol, you need to refer to its definitive
source.  For most protocols on the Internet, that's the
RFCs.

<p>
For example, let's say you wanted to research holes in
Internet multicast.  You could go to either of those RFC
databases &amp; search for ``multicast''.  You conclude that
any of these RFCs were worth your time
<table cellpadding="3" border="1">

<p>
That's just an example.  By the way, if none of those title
make you at least a little curious to know what's in those
documents, then you might not be cut-out to be a computer
hacker or a cracker.
