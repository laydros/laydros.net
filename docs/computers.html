	        Nerdy stuff for my own curiosity. Fun to look at later. Last updated 2023-11-10

          I have mostly named my computers after guitar makes or models. Some people create new names for every machine, I keep the same names around for replacements.

          - I didn't wait for the 16" to come out because I figured Apple would bump the price up again. Instead they came out at the same price with 2X drive space and put the Escape key back. So I'll probably try to sell this and get one of those before the 3-year warranty on the butterfly keyboard expires. However I was happy to upgrade to this with 16GB of RAM and a much more powerful CPU for when I'm running VMs, along with better graphics for rare gaming, compared to my old 13"
          - Almost entirely used in clamshell with external keyboard, mouse, monitor both at home and at work.

          <h3>Software</h3>Currently running a lot of Apple stuff because I'm tired of tweaking things.
          After running vim for many years, I mostly use emacs now for local development. I still often use vim on remote connections.
          I sometimes use Sublime Text, VS Code, or BBEdit.
          I like a lot of Mac specific apps like Acorn, OmniFocus, Alfred, CodeRunner, DaisyDisk, Fantastical 2, iTerm, OpenEmu, Transmit
          I do a lot on the command line. Honestly I run sftp or scp more often than I run Transmit, but in some use cases the GUI tools are helpful.
          Typically I do my web browsing with Safari purely for the tab syncing between my phone, computer, and iPad. I go through periods of mostly using Firefox. I'm trying to avoid Google Chrome these days since browsers are again becoming a mono-culture.
